# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Online Retail Dataset

This project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the popular **Online Retail** dataset. The aim is to uncover trends, identify anomalies, and derive business insights from transaction-level e-commerce data using Python-based data analysis tools.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset used is the **UCI Online Retail dataset**, which contains transactional data for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail over a year.

It includes:
- **InvoiceNo**: Invoice number
- **StockCode**: Product code
- **Description**: Product name
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the product purchased
- **InvoiceDate**: Date of the invoice
- **UnitPrice**: Price per product
- **CustomerID**: ID of the customer
- **Country**: Country of the customer

## 🔍 Key EDA Insights
- Overview of missing data and data cleaning steps
- Revenue analysis by:
  - Time (month, day, hour)
  - Product categories
  - Countries
- Customer behavior patterns
- Identification of top-selling and underperforming products
- Trend analysis using time series plots
- Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 📊 Visualizations Include
- Bar charts and histograms
- Heatmaps for correlation analysis
- Time-series line plots
- Pie charts for country-wise contributions

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run the notebook locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Safa-Ali-Ahmed/EDA-OnlineRetail-Python-Analysis.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ``you should install required libiraries like pandas,matplotlib,numpy and python in the first place if you will use VS code but you can use GoogleColab and there is no need for installing any thing
 
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook EDA-for-OnlineRetail.ipynb
   ```
